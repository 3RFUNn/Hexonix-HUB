How to use this asset
---------------------
Firstly, you should run the Demo Scene provided to get an idea of the overall functionality.
Later, you should read the documentation and experiment with the tool.

Hint: to use the asset, drag the Grids2D prefab from Resources/Prefabs folder to your scene.


Demo Scene
----------
There's one demo scene, located in "Demos" folder. Just go there from Unity, open "Demo1" scene and run it.


Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The PDF is located in the Doc folder. It contains instructions on how to use the prefab and the API so you can control it from your code.


Support
